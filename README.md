## Ecommerce Website Drippy

Welcome to my Ecommerce website, this is not an official website that makes sales but is rather a React project I built to refine my
skills and take on new challenges. It includes user interface frameworks such as MaterialUI and Bootstrap.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
